# üß† Brain Tumor Detection with YOLOv10 and Gradio Interface

An AI-powered solution for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans using the latest YOLOv10 deep learning model. This project is designed to assist radiologists by quickly identifying potential tumor areas with high accuracy and consistency.

# üöÄ Features
  - YOLOv10 Model: Utilizes the YOLOv10 architecture, fine-tuned specifically for brain tumor detection in MRI scans.
  - Real-Time Detection: Provides fast and accurate predictions, with bounding boxes around detected tumors, reducing the need for exhaustive manual review.
  - Gradio Interface: Offers an interactive web interface for easy MRI scan upload and visualization of model outputs, including annotated tumor areas and confidence scores.
  - High Sensitivity: Optimized for detecting small and early-stage tumors, aiding in early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.
  - Scalable and Adaptable: Capable of handling large MRI datasets and adaptable for detecting other types of medical anomalies.
# üìù Project Workflow
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: MRI data sourced from Roboflow, preprocessed with normalization, resizing, and augmentation for model training.
2. Model Training: YOLOv10 model is fine-tuned with labeled MRI scans, using hyperparameter optimization for enhanced accuracy in medical imaging.
3. Detection Interface: Gradio-powered UI for real-time tumor detection, with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
4. Result Logging and Feedback: Detection results are logged, with optional feedback for ongoing improvement and model refinement.
